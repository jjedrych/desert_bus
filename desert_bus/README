One of my very first projects from high school, its easy to say I've come a long way since then :)

This project a very primitive recreation of Desert Bus on the Sega CD (gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LtiHla1dNg) 

I did the best I could to carry over/add these following features:
- An endless gameplay loop
- Day and night cycle based on the system local time
- A realtime clock
- Misaligned steering that shifts the car to the left as you drive
- lack of a pause feature

How you Play

Press and hold SPACEBAR to accelerate while using A and D to steer. In order to score a point the player must drive approximately 
1 hour contiunously. If the player drives off the road they will recieve a game over and must restart from 0 distance travelled
