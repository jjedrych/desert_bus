Thank You for downloading Desert Bus: Deep Fried Edition!

This is a faithful recreation of the classic Desert Bus, keeping the same 
painful experience, but in the language of Java.

Features
-A vast and endless desert!
-A realtime day and night cycle!
-A working clock to keep track of how much time you've wasted!
-No pause because you can't pause while drving!
-Boredom!

How to Play
First things first cowboy you should probably press and hold SPACEBAR to
accelerate while using WASD to steer. The bus' wheels are a little funky so
you should try your best to stay on the road, otherwise you'll crash and your
insurance rates will go through the roof. 

The main objective of the game is to score as many points as you can. To earn
one point you must drive a total of 1 hour (yes I've tested this) in the hot
desert heat. I'm willing to bet $5 dollars you won't beat my all time highscore
of 10. (basically I'm offering you to play test my game for 50 cents per hour)

Well don't just sit there, jump into the world Desert Bus: Deep Fried Edition!
